      <p>
        You are just soo cute, funny, annoying as fuck, adorable and everything else. I love you sooo much and I know I fuck up a lot, or can make you mad from time to time. But I hope you can forgive me for that. I will always be determined to show and prove to you that I am worthy to be your husband and lover forever. Everybody else can try but I promise you that I am worth a lot more than they are even if it may not seem that way sometimes. My love you deserve the world and I want to give you that. I think you and I both didn't expect us to be here in this spot, talking to each other again after everything we have been through. But I love you so much to give up that easily and accept defeat. I want to make sure that your first boyfriend will be your last. I made this for you so please be honest and tell me what you think!!
      </p>
      <p>I really hope you enjoy it!! If you want me to express myself more tell me</p>
      <p>I love you. You will always hold my heart in your hands. Continue pls</p>
